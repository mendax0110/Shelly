# shelly
A simple shell written in C++

The original shell was written by:

The shell can run the built-in commands below or any commands in the /bin or /usr/bin folders.
Built-in commands have precedence over commands in these folders if names are shared. 

Commands can be run from an interactive shell or from a file of commands passed as a command line argument.

To use this program, download all files, and run make. The program can be run without arguments for an interactive shell
or with a single argument specifying a file containing shell commands separated by new lines.
